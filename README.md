## About

This JavaScript application is made to create a page with cards that are dynamically created with team members on them. The page is styled very simply so you can focus on the important parts. This application could be used easily on it's own or even within other pages or applications. This program was coded by creating tests and coding against them.

## How To Use

This program thrives on it's user friendly interface and simplicity. First you will start by installing all necesary files. This can be done by entering the command `npm init` in your console/terminal. Then you will run a `npm install` command in the terminal/console. After this you can run the final command `node index.js`. This will now prompt you with questions regarding information of your team members. After answering all the questions a html page will be generated in the dist folder.
